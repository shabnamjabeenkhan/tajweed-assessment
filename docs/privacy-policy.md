# Privacy Policy

Last updated: October 15, 2025

Tajweed Simplified ("we", "our", or "us") provides an online assessment tool that helps learners practice Tajweed rules. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard information when you access Tajweed Simplified through our web application (the "Service").

Because we take your privacy seriously, we keep data collection to the minimum required to operate the Service. By using the Service, you consent to the practices described in this policy. If you do not agree with these practices, please discontinue use of the Service.

## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Personal Information You Provide
- **Account information:** name and email address collected during sign-up through Clerk authentication.
- **Support requests:** any information you voluntarily submit when contacting us.

We do not collect payment information because the Service is currently free.

### 1.2 Information Collected Automatically
- **Usage data:** anonymized analytics events (e.g., pages visited, quiz completions) captured via tooling such as Supabase, UserJot, and DataFast for performance and product insights.
- **Device and log data:** IP address, browser type, referring/exit pages, and timestamps captured through Vercel hosting logs.
- **Cookies and similar technologies:** session cookies to keep you signed in and analytics cookies for aggregate usage reporting (see Section 2).

### 1.3 Non-Personal Information
- Aggregated statistics about quiz performance and streaks.
- General diagnostic data used to improve stability.

## 2. Cookies and Tracking Technologies

We use cookies, web beacons, and similar tracking technologies to:
- Maintain authenticated sessions managed by Clerk.
- Remember preferences such as selected Tajweed rules.
- Collect analytics via services like Plunk and DataFast.

You can instruct your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, rejecting essential cookies may impair certain functionality of the Service.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use collected data to:
- Provide, operate, and maintain the Service.
- Authenticate users and secure accounts.
- Monitor usage and improve quizzes.
- Detect, prevent, and address technical issues.
- Communicate important updates or policy changes.

## 4. How We Share Your Information

We do not sell or rent personal information. We only share data with third-party processors that enable core functionality:
- **Clerk** for authentication and secure identity management.
- **Supabase** for data storage and analytics infrastructure.
- **Stripe** (dormant) for future payment capabilities; no payment data is currently processed.
- **Plunk, UserJot, DataFast** for analytics, engagement insights, and feedback capture.
- **Vercel** for hosting and operational logging.

Each provider is contractually obligated to safeguard your data and use it solely to provide their services. We may also disclose information if required by law, to protect our rights, or to investigate fraud or security issues.

## 5. Data Storage and Security

- Data is stored in Supabase-managed databases and Convex infrastructure located in data centers with industry-standard security controls.
- Clerk handles passwordless authentication tokens and enforces secure session handling.
- We apply encryption in transit (HTTPS) and rely on provider-level encryption at rest.
- Access to personal data is restricted to essential personnel and protected by multi-factor authentication.
- We regularly review security practices and update dependencies to mitigate vulnerabilities.

Despite our efforts, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security but we commit to notifying users of any data breaches in accordance with applicable laws.

## 6. Data Retention

We keep personal information for as long as your account remains active. If you request deletion, we will remove your personal data (subject to legal obligations) within 30 days and anonymize related analytics.

## 7. Your Rights

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the following rights:
- **Access:** request a copy of the personal data we hold about you.
- **Rectification:** request corrections to inaccurate or incomplete data.
- **Deletion:** request deletion of your personal information.
- **Restriction:** request that we limit processing in certain circumstances.
- **Portability:** request transfer of your data to another service in a commonly used format.
- **Objection:** object to processing, including for direct marketing (though we currently do not conduct marketing).

To exercise any of these rights, contact us through the in-app support channel. We will respond within 30 days and may require verification of identity.

## 8. Children's Privacy

The Service is not intended for children under 13 years of age, or the minimum age required by local law. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to delete that information promptly.

## 9. International Transfers

Your data may be processed in countries other than your own. We rely on contractual safeguards and provider compliance (including Standard Contractual Clauses where applicable) to protect data transferred internationally.

## 10. GDPR and CCPA Compliance

- **GDPR:** If you are located in the European Economic Area, Tajweed Simplified acts as a data controller. The legal bases for processing include contract performance (providing the Service) and legitimate interests (improving functionality).
- **CCPA:** We do not sell personal information. California residents may request disclosure or deletion of their data through the in-app support channel.

## 11. Policy Updates

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted within the Service with an updated "Last updated" date. If changes materially affect your rights, we will provide additional notice (e.g., in-app notification). Continued use after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised Policy.
