# Refund Policy

Last updated: October 15, 2025

Tajweed Simplified currently operates as a free service. Because no payments are collected, refunds are generally not applicable. This policy explains our stance and how we will handle refunds should we introduce paid offerings in the future.

## 1. Free Access
- All features of Tajweed Simplified are available at no cost.
- Since no subscription fees or one-time payments are charged, there is nothing to refund.

## 2. Future Paid Features
If we introduce paid plans in the future, we will update this policy to cover:
- Eligibility criteria for refunds.
- Timeframes for requesting refunds (e.g., within a specified number of days).
- Steps for submitting a refund request.
- Exceptions or non-refundable items.
- Processing timelines and communication flow.

We will provide clear notice before implementing any paid offerings or modifying this policy.

## 3. Contact
If you have questions about this policy or potential future billing, email us at `admin@tech-horizonai.io`.
