# Tajweed Quiz MVP – Brand Identity Guidelines

## Typography
- **Headings:** "Poppins" (Google Fonts) – geometric sans with friendly curves, mirroring the clean UI vibe. Use `600` weight for H1/H2, `500` for H3.
- **Body:** "Inter" (Google Fonts) – high legibility at small sizes, pairs naturally with Poppins. Default weight `400`, captions `300`.
- **Display Accent (optional):** "Sora" for hero stats or score percentages to add a modern touch while staying consistent.

## Logo Direction
- Favor a **minimal wordmark + subtle icon**. Combine the name with a stylized Quranic diacritic mark or waveform representing recitation precision.
- Keep line weights balanced for small favicon usage. Avoid overly ornate calligraphy; lean into clean geometry with slight rounded corners to match UI components.
- Animated variants (score pulse) can be introduced for future premium tiers, but static logo should remain simple for trust.

## Color Palette
- **Primary:** Emerald Green `#10B981` – evokes growth and calm, matches practice success states.
- **Secondary:** Midnight Blue `#1E3A8A` – anchors navigation/header elements.
- **Accent:** Saffron `#F59E0B` – used sparingly for streak badges and warning states.
- **Neutrals:**
  - Background: `#F9FAFB`
  - Surface: `#FFFFFF`
  - Text Primary: `#111827`
  - Text Muted: `#6B7280`
  - Border: `#E5E7EB`
- Ensure accessible contrast with WCAG AA compliance; adjust accent usage if paired with white text.

## Imagery & Iconography
- Use lightweight line icons (Lucide set) with rounded edges; avoid heavy skeuomorphic Quran imagery.
- Photography (if used) should be soft-focus study scenes, diverse learners, neutral backgrounds.

## Voice & Tone
- Encouraging, respectful, and concise. Focus on progress (“Keep building mastery”) rather than judgment.
- Copy guidelines: highlight repetitions, streaks, and actionable next steps.

## Usage Notes
- Tailwind theme tokens should map to palette (`primary`, `secondary`, `accent`, `muted`, `foreground`).
- Maintain consistent use of whitespace and rounded corners to reinforce calm learning environment.
