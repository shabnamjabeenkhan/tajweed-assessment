# Tajweed Quiz MVP

## Overview
Beginner Quran students (13–30, English-speaking, self-guided) need a lightweight, ad-free practice tool focused on individual Tajweed rules. Existing apps feel noisy or complicated, so the core proposition is a repeatable, rule-specific quiz experience that tracks improvement and delivers actionable feedback after every run.

## Business Model
Launch free and ad-free to validate engagement. Track weekly active quiz takers to prove retention, and funnel insights into a future premium tier (e.g., advanced rule packs, instructor insights) once baseline adoption is confirmed.

## Core MVP Features
- **Rule-Focused Quiz Runs:** Pick a Tajweed rule from a curated list and answer a fixed set of multiple-choice questions with skip/"I don’t know" options plus progress tracking.
- **Immediate Feedback Dashboard:** After each run, show score, rule-specific feedback prompts, and attempt history so learners can iterate quickly.
