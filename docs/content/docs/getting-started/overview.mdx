  **DO NOT upgrade any dependencies in your package.json** for the core stack dependencies (Clerk, Convex, Polar.sh, etc.), unless you have a specific reason to and are following the official migration guides from each service. Upgrading packages without proper migration can break your authentication, database connections, and other critical functionality. The current versions in the boilerplate are tested and stable together.

## Pre-requisites

1. Frontend Knowledge (Have completed the Frontend section of the Software Engineer Roadmap) so that your base HTML, CSS, JS and React skills are up to par.
2. Fundamental Backend Systems Knowledge (Have completed the [Systems Expert Fundamentals Course](https://www.algoexpert.io/systems/fundamentals) of the Software Engineer Roadmap)
3. Fundamental Tech Stack Knowledge (Have completed the [Kaizen Tech Stack Tutorial](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUxlPfFPDnAEI0roJMdV49n29gFFzmEQ5&feature=shared))

## Tech Stack

- [React Router v7](https://reactrouter.com/) - Modern full-stack React framework with SSR
- [Convex](https://convex.dev/) - Real-time database and serverless functions
- [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) - Authentication as a Service Provider
- [Polar.sh](https://polar.sh/) - Subscription billing and payments
- [Resend](https://resend.com/) - Email as a Service Provider
- [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) - AI chat capabilities (optional)
- [Railway](https://railway.app/) - Deployments without worrying about infrastructure (Auto-Scaling, DDoS protection, etc.)

## Cost of running this stack

All of the above services have generous free tiers.

Even as your product grows, the cost remains minimal (averaging $200-300/month with 10,000+ DAUs for 80%+ profit margin).

These 3rd party services abstract away significant infrastructure work in key areas (authentication, database, payments, etc.), letting you focus solely on building your product.
