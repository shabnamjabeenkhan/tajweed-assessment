<Note>
This learning was documented on [Date], while implementing [Feature/Component]. I was struggling to understand [specific concept or problem].
</Note>

## The Problem I Encountered

[Describe the specific problem, confusion, or challenge you faced. Be specific about what wasn't working or what you didn't understand.]

## Key Learning: [Main Concept]

### What Is [Concept]?
[Define the main concept you learned. Keep it clear and concise.]

### How Does [Concept] Work?
[Explain how the concept works in practice. Include the "why" behind it.]

## Visual Understanding

    A[Input] -→ B[Process]
    B -→ C[Output]
    
    D[Context] -→ B
    E[Configuration] -→ B

    style C fill:#7c2d12
    style B fill:#14532d

## Code Examples

### ❌ Wrong Approach (What I Was Doing)

```typescript
// This doesn't work - explain why
export const [functionName] = [functionType]({
  // Show the incorrect implementation
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    // Wrong code here
  },
});
```

### ✅ Correct Approach

```typescript
// This works - explain why
export const [functionName] = [functionType]({
  // Show the correct implementation
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    // Correct code here
  },
});
```

## Real-world Example

[Provide a practical example from your actual implementation. Show how this learning applies to real code.]

```tsx
// Show how you implemented this in your React component
export function [ComponentName]() {
  // Implementation using the learned concept
  
  return (
    <div>
      {/* JSX showing the concept in action */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Key Patterns I Learned

### 1. [Pattern Name]

```typescript
// Show the pattern with code
export const [example] = [pattern] => {
  // Pattern implementation
};
```

### 2. [Pattern Name]

```typescript
// Show another pattern
export const [example] = [pattern] => {
  // Pattern implementation
};
```

### 3. [Pattern Name]

```typescript
// Show third pattern
export const [example] = [pattern] => {
  // Pattern implementation
};
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. [Mistake Name]
```typescript
// ❌ Don't do this
export const [example] = [wrong] => {
  // Show the mistake
};
```

### 2. [Mistake Name]
```typescript
// ❌ Don't do this
export const [example] = [wrong] => {
  // Show the mistake
};
```

### 3. [Mistake Name]
```typescript
// ❌ Don't do this
export const [example] = [wrong] => {
  // Show the mistake
};
```

## Performance Considerations

### [Performance Topic]
```typescript
// ✅ Optimized approach
export const [optimized] = [function] => {
  // Show performance optimization
};
```

### [Performance Topic]
```typescript
// ✅ Another optimization
export const [optimized] = [function] => {
  // Show another optimization
};
```

## When to Use [Concept]

| Use Case | When to Use | Reason |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| [Case 1] | [When] | [Why] |
| [Case 2] | [When] | [Why] |
| [Case 3] | [When] | [Why] |
