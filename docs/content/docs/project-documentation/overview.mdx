Use this section to document your MVP as you build it with Kaizen. Keep track of your ideas, architecture decisions, costs, and database design.

## What to Document

<Cards>
  <Card title="Idea" href="/project-documentation/idea" description="Your product vision, target audience, and core features" />
  <Card title="Architecture" href="/project-documentation/architecture" description="System design, tech stack decisions, and infrastructure" />
  <Card title="Cost Estimation" href="/project-documentation/cost-estimation" description="Projected costs for development and operations" />
  <Card title="Database Schema" href="/project-documentation/database-schema" description="Data models, relationships, and schema design" />
</Cards>

## Why Document?

- **Clarity**: Writing down your ideas helps clarify your vision
- **Reference**: Easy to reference design decisions later
- **Collaboration**: Share your vision with team members or stakeholders
- **Progress Tracking**: See how your project evolves over time
- **Knowledge Base**: Build institutional knowledge for your startup

## Getting Started

1. Start with your **Idea** - define what you're building and why
2. Design your **Architecture** - decide how the system will work
3. Estimate your **Costs** - understand your burn rate
4. Define your **Database Schema** - plan your data structure
