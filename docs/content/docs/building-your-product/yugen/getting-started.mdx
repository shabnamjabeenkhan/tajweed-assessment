### Create GitHub Repository
Create a fresh, empty repository on GitHub (private recommended)

Copy the SSH URL (not HTTPS): `git@github.com:username/repo-name.git`

</Step>

<Step>

### Clone Yugen and Set Up Project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/code-and-creed/yugen.git my-app
cd my-app
rm -rf .git
git init
git remote add origin your-github-repo-url
```

</Step>

</Steps>

## Project Structure

The project structure differs from other templates. The root directory has a limited number of files - this is a monorepo setup containing multiple apps and packages.

```
my-app/
├── apps/
│   ├── user/              # Consumer-facing TanStack Start app
│   └── data-service/      # Backend service for long-running tasks
├── packages/
│   └── data-ops/          # Shared database logic
└── pnpm-workspace.yaml
```

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>

### Install Dependencies and Build

```bash
pnpm run setup
```

This installs all dependencies and builds the `data-ops` package used by the apps.

</Step>

<Step>

### Start Development Server

```bash
pnpm run dev:user
```

The TanStack Start app will start. You can rename this app if you like - the name showcases that it's the app users will interact with.

</Step>

<Step>

### Documentation UI

The UI acts as documentation for setting things up. Once you get your database and authentication set up, delete the documentation pages:

```bash
# Delete the kit-content folder and files within the static route
rm -rf apps/user/app/routes/kit-content
rm -rf apps/user/app/routes/static
```

</Step>
</Steps>

## Deploy Early (Motivating!)

Before setting up the database, deploy the application right away:

```bash
pnpm run deploy:user
```

This deploys to Cloudflare Workers (requires Cloudflare account). Cloudflare gives you a URL to view your deployment.

### Customize Cloudflare Worker Name

```toml title="apps/user/wrangler.toml"
name = "my-app"  # Change this
```

You can also add custom domains associated with your Cloudflare account by adding a route to this file.
