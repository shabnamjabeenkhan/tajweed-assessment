## What is Yugen?

A starter kit that helps you build scalable software fast. At a high level, this template provides:

- **Authentication** using BetterAuth
- **Payments and subscriptions** with Polar.sh
- **Drizzle ORM** so you can bring whatever relational database you prefer
- **Deploys out of the box** to Cloudflare Workers (free hobby projects to high-volume services)

## Project Structure That Scales

The template implements a **pnpm workspace monorepo** that can truly scale with complexity. Design software as modular components that can be pieced together.

### The `data-ops` Package

The monorepo allows you to create lightweight packages of reusable code shared across multiple apps. Example: `data-ops` package contains all core logic for:

- Managing Drizzle schemas
- Creating database clients
- Defining database queries

These queries can be used in both the consumer-facing TanStack Start app and a separate backend service that handles long-running tasks.

## Tech Stack

- **TanStack Start** - Full-stack React framework
- **BetterAuth** - Authentication framework
- **Polar.sh** - Merchant of record for payments
- **Drizzle ORM** - Type-safe database queries
- **Cloudflare Workers** - Edge deployment

## Two Core Services

The template starts you with two services:

1. **User Application** - UI and user-triggered transactions
2. **Data Service** - Processing data and managing long-running background tasks (queue consumers, Durable Objects, workflows)
