Deploys out of the box to Cloudflare, which can accommodate:
- Free hobby projects
- Serious high-volume services

## Deploy Command

```bash
pnpm run deploy:user
```

Cloudflare gives you a URL to view your deployment.

## Configuration

### Worker Name

Change the name in `wrangler.toml`:

```toml title="apps/user/wrangler.toml"
name = "my-app"
```

### Custom Domains

Add routes for custom domains associated with your Cloudflare account:

```toml title="apps/user/wrangler.toml"
routes = [
  { pattern = "example.com", zone_name = "example.com" }
]
```
