All projects in Yugen have **two core services**:

1. **User Application** - Contains UI, manages user-triggered transactions
2. **Data Service** - Processing data, managing long-running background tasks

### What Lives in the Data Service?

- Queue consumers
- Durable Objects
- Workflows
- Container-based workflows using Cloudflare Containers

### Configure Durable Object

```toml title="apps/data-service/wrangler.toml"
// Copy Durable Object configuration
```

### Deploy Data Service

```bash
pnpm run deploy:data-service
```

### Shared Data-Ops Package

Both user app and data service use the same `data-ops` package for type-safe database queries. Ensures consistency across services.

## Next Steps

You now have a complete understanding of Yugen's architecture:
- Monorepo with shared packages
- User application with auth and payments
- Data service for background tasks
- Deployable to Cloudflare Workers
