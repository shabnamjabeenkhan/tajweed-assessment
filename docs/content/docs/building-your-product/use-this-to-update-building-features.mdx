# Building Features

Learn how to build any feature quickly and correctly using spec-driven development and AI assistance.

## The Feature Development Process

<Steps>
<Step>

### 1. Plan First (Voice is Best!)

<Note>
**Remember**: Talk to your machine using voice input. It's 2-3x faster than typing!
</Note>

**Before writing any code:**
1. Explain what you want to build (use voice!)
2. Describe the user experience
3. Identify data requirements
4. List edge cases and error states

**Example Voice Prompt:**
```
"I want to add a feature where users can export their time entries 
as a PDF invoice. When they click 'Export Invoice' on the dashboard, 
it should open a modal where they select date range, then generate 
a professional-looking PDF with their logo, client info, line items, 
and total. The PDF should be emailed to them via Resend."
```

</Step>

<Step>

### 2. Use Spec-Driven Development

Use tools like [Samurai Agent](https://github.com/suzuking1192/samurai-agent) for spec-driven development.

**What is Spec-Driven Development?**
- Write detailed specification BEFORE coding
- AI generates implementation plan
- Review and approve plan
- AI implements based on approved spec

<Warning>
**Don't skip the spec!** Writing code without a plan leads to:
- Incomplete features
- Missed edge cases
- Bugs and rework
- Wasted time
</Warning>

**Example Spec:**
```markdown
# Feature: PDF Invoice Export

## User Story
As a freelancer, I want to export my time entries as a professional 
PDF invoice so I can send it to clients for payment.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] "Export Invoice" button on dashboard
- [ ] Modal with date range picker
- [ ] Preview of invoice before export
- [ ] PDF includes company logo, client info, line items
- [ ] Email sent via Resend with PDF attached
- [ ] Loading state while generating
- [ ] Success/error notifications

## Technical Requirements
- Use @react-pdf/renderer for PDF generation
- Store invoice metadata in Convex
- Send email via Resend API
- Handle failures gracefully

## Edge Cases
- No time entries in selected range
- Email delivery failure
- PDF generation timeout
- Invalid date range
```

</Step>

<Step>

### 3. Remind AI to Use Context7 MCP

**Always remind your AI assistant to use Context7 MCP** for up-to-date library documentation.

**Example Prompt:**
```
"Before we start, please use Context7 MCP to fetch the latest docs 
for @react-pdf/renderer so you have accurate API information."
```

This ensures:
- ✅ Accurate API usage
- ✅ Latest best practices
- ✅ Correct installation commands
- ✅ Up-to-date examples

</Step>

<Step>

### 4. Review the Plan

**Before implementation, review the AI's plan:**

**Check for:**
- ✅ All acceptance criteria covered?
- ✅ Edge cases handled?
- ✅ Performance considerations?
- ✅ Security implications?
- ✅ Testing strategy?

**Ask clarifying questions:**
```
"What happens if the PDF generation fails?"
"How do we handle large date ranges (1000+ entries)?"
"Where should we store the generated PDFs?"
"What if the user's email bounces?"
```

**Example AI Review:**
- [Aravind's Tweet on AI Code Review](https://x.com/aravindputrevu/status/1967958142626697419?t=TM7DuFYNKm9YD2A-6RDI5g&s=19)
- [BigAIGuy's Tweet on Feature Planning](https://x.com/bigaiguy/status/1967970906560749677?t=8s5aMoc57plDbP5k7QNESw&s=19)

</Step>

<Step>

### 5. Implement the Feature

**Only once you're happy with the plan:**

```
"The plan looks good. Please implement this feature now.
Start with the UI components, then the PDF generation logic,
then the email sending. Show me each step as you go."
```

**Implementation Tips:**
- Work in small increments
- Test each part before moving on
- Ask for explanations if unclear
- Request refactoring if code looks messy

</Step>

<Step>

### 6. Code Review with CodeRabbit

**Use CodeRabbit to review the changes:**

[CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai/) automatically:
- Reviews PRs for bugs and issues
- Suggests improvements
- Checks best practices
- Finds security vulnerabilities

**Manual Review Checklist:**
- [ ] Code is readable and well-documented
- [ ] No hardcoded values (use env vars)
- [ ] Error handling in place
- [ ] Loading states for async operations
- [ ] TypeScript types are correct
- [ ] No console.logs left in code

</Step>

<Step>

### 7. Test the Feature

**Manual Testing:**
1. Happy path (everything works)
2. Error paths (things break)
3. Edge cases (unusual inputs)
4. Mobile responsiveness
5. Different user roles

**Automated Testing** (if applicable):
```typescript
// Example test
it('generates PDF invoice for date range', async () => {
  const entries = await getTimeEntries(userId, startDate, endDate);
  const pdf = await generateInvoice(entries);
  expect(pdf).toBeDefined();
  expect(pdf.pageCount).toBeGreaterThan(0);
});
```

</Step>
</Steps>

## AI-Assisted Feature Building

### Useful Prompts

**Planning:**
```
"I want to build [feature]. Help me create a detailed spec 
including user stories, acceptance criteria, technical requirements, 
and edge cases. Use the spec-driven development approach."
```

**Implementation:**
```
"Based on the approved spec, implement [feature]. 
Use Context7 MCP for @react-pdf/renderer docs. 
Show me the implementation plan before coding."
```

**Refactoring:**
```
"This code works but looks messy. Refactor it to be:
- More readable
- Better typed
- Properly abstracted
- Following React best practices"
```

**Debugging:**
```
"The PDF generation is failing with this error: [paste error].
Here's the relevant code: @file.ts
What's wrong and how do I fix it?"
```
