# Deploy to Railway

Railway is the recommended deployment platform for Kaizen. It's perfect for teams and solo developers who want automatic deployments, PR preview environments, and easy environment variable management.

## Why Railway?

- âœ… **Automatic deployments** on every push
- âœ… **PR preview environments** for testing
- âœ… **Easy environment variable management**
- âœ… **Simple GitHub integration**
- âœ… **Dockerfile support** with bun runtime

## Prerequisites

Before deploying to Railway:

- [ ] Railway account ([sign up](https://railway.app))
- [ ] GitHub repository with your code
- [ ] Production Convex deployment ready
- [ ] All environment variables gathered

## Deployment Steps

<Steps>
<Step>

### Push Code to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for Railway deployment"
git push origin main
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Create Railway Project

1. Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Authorize Railway to access your repository
5. Select your Kaizen repository

</Step>

### Configure Build Settings

Railway auto-detects your app from the Dockerfile. Verify the settings:

**Build Command:**
```bash
bun run build
```

**Start Command:**
```bash
bun run start
```

**Root Directory:**
- Leave as `/` (project root)

**Runtime:**

</Step>

<Step>

### Set Environment Variables

In Railway Dashboard â†’ Your Project â†’ Variables, add:

**Core:**
```bash
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=8080
```

**Convex:**
```bash
VITE_CONVEX_URL=https://your-deployment.convex.cloud
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=your-deployment-name
```

**Authentication (if enabled):**
```bash
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
```

**Payments (if enabled):**
```bash
POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN=polar_...
POLAR_ORGANIZATION_ID=org_...
POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

**AI Features (if enabled):**
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

**Email (if enabled):**
```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=re_...
RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

**Monitoring (optional):**
```bash
VITE_SENTRY_DSN=https://your-dsn@sentry.io/project-id
OPENSTATUS_API_KEY=your-key
OPENSTATUS_PROJECT_ID=your-project
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Deploy

Railway will automatically deploy when you:
- Push to your main branch
- Manually trigger a deployment
- Create a pull request (creates preview environment)

Your app will be live at `https://your-app.up.railway.app`

</Step>

<Step>

### Configure Custom Domain (Optional)

1. **In Railway Dashboard:**
   - Go to Settings â†’ Domains
   - Click "Generate Domain" (get free railway.app domain)
   - Or click "Custom Domain" to add your own

2. **For custom domains:**

   - Railway handles SSL automatically

3. **Update service configurations:**
   - Update Clerk allowed origins
   - Update webhook URLs
   - Update Polar.sh redirect URLs

</Step>
</Steps>

## Configure Production Services

### Convex Production Deployment

```bash
npx convex deploy --cmd-url-env-var-name=VITE_CONVEX_URL --prod
```

### Update Webhook URLs

After deployment, update webhook URLs for all integrated services:

**Clerk** (if using authentication):
- Dashboard â†’ Webhooks â†’ Add endpoint
- URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/clerk`

**Polar.sh** (if using payments):
- Dashboard â†’ Webhooks â†’ Add endpoint
- URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/polar`

**Resend** (if using email):
- Dashboard â†’ Webhooks â†’ Add endpoint  
- URL: `https://your-deployment.convex.cloud/resend-webhook`

## Post-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Homepage loads correctly
- [ ] Authentication works (if enabled)
- [ ] Real-time features work with Convex
- [ ] Webhook endpoints are accessible
- [ ] PR preview environments work
- [ ] Custom domain configured (if applicable)
- [ ] SSL certificate is active

## Maintenance

### View Logs

Railway Dashboard â†’ Your Project â†’ Deployments â†’ View Logs

### Redeploy

- Or click "Redeploy" in Railway Dashboard

### Rollback

Railway Dashboard â†’ Deployments â†’ Select previous deployment â†’ Redeploy

### Monitor Usage

Railway Dashboard â†’ Usage â†’ View metrics and costs

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

- Check build logs in Railway Dashboard
- Verify `package.json` scripts are correct
- Ensure all dependencies are in `dependencies` (not just `devDependencies`)
- Verify Dockerfile is using bun correctly

### Environment Variables Not Working

- Verify variables are set in Railway Dashboard
- Check variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Redeploy after adding/changing variables

### Port Binding Issues

- Ensure your app listens on `process.env.PORT || 8080`
- Railway automatically assigns PORT

### Database Connection Issues

- Verify Convex deployment is live
- Check CONVEX_URL environment variable
- Test API endpoints manually
