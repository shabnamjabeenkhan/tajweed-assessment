## Prerequisites

### 1. Create a Sentry Account

<Cards>
  <Card
    title="Sign up for Sentry"
    href="https://sentry.io"
    description="Create a free account to start monitoring errors and performance."
  />
</Cards>

1. Create a new project for your application
2. Select **Node.js** as the platform
3. Copy your **DSN (Data Source Name)** - you'll need this for the integration

### 2. Upgrade to Convex Pro

Convex's Sentry integration is only available on the Pro plan:

1. Go to your [Convex Dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev)
2. Select your deployment
3. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Billing**
4. Upgrade to the **Pro** plan

### 3. Understand Sentry Concepts

#### Automatic Tags

Convex automatically tags every exception with the following metadata:

| Tag | Description | Example |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| `func` | Function name in string format | `"messages:send"` |
| `func_type` | Type of Convex function | `"query"`, `"mutation"`, `"action"`, `"http_action"` |
| `func_runtime` | Function runtime environment | `"default"` or `"node"` |
| `request_id` | Unique request identifier for debugging | `"abc123def456"` |
| `server_name` | Deployment name | `"happy-animal-123"` |
| `environment` | Deployment environment | `"prod"`, `"dev"`, or `"preview"` |
| `user` | Authenticated user's token identifier (if auth enabled) | `"https://clerk.com/user_123"` |

#### Custom Tags (Optional)

You can add custom tags during setup to further categorize errors:

```plaintext
version: "1.0.0"
team: "backend"
region: "us-west"
```

These tags help you:
- Filter errors by release version
- Route alerts to specific teams
- Track errors by geographic region

## Error Monitoring with Sentry

Track and monitor errors from your Convex backend functions using Sentry's built-in integration.

### 1. Configure Convex's Sentry Integration

1. Go to your Convex Dashboard
2. Select your deployment
3. Click on **Settings** in the sidebar
4. Select the **Integrations** tab
5. Click on the **Sentry** card
6. Enter your **Sentry DSN** from your Sentry project settings
7. (Optional) Add custom tags to categorize errors
8. Click **Save** to enable the integration

### 2. Verify the Integration

1. Trigger an error in one of your Convex functions (you can temporarily throw an error for testing)
2. Check your Sentry dashboard within 1-2 minutes
3. You should see the error event with Convex-specific tags

### Finding Errors in Sentry

Once configured, errors will appear in your Sentry dashboard with:

1. **Stack traces** showing where the error occurred
2. **Convex-specific context** (function name, type, runtime)
3. **User information** (if authenticated)
4. **Request ID** for correlation with Convex logs

<Note>
**Debugging Tip**: Use the `request_id` tag to find the corresponding logs in your Convex Dashboard under the Logs tab.
</Note>

### Sentry Limitations

- **Propagation delay**: Exceptions may take 1-2 minutes to appear in Sentry
- **SDK features**: Built-in integration doesn't support advanced Sentry SDK customization
- **Backend only**: This integration only tracks Convex function errors, not frontend errors

## Uptime Monitoring with OpenStatus

Set up uptime monitoring for your application using OpenStatus.

### 1. Create an OpenStatus Account

<Cards>
  <Card
    title="Sign up for OpenStatus"
    href="https://openstatus.dev"
    description="Create a free account to start monitoring uptime and performance."
  />
</Cards>

1. Create an account
2. Create a new workspace/project
