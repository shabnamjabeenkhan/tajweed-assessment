Every time you come back to work on your project, start your development environment:

## 1. Frontend Web Server

In one terminal, run the following command:

```bash
bun run dev
```

## 2. Convex Backend Server

In another terminal, run the following command:

```bash
bunx convex dev
```

## 3. Webhook Testing

In another terminal, run the following command:

```bash
ngrok http 5173
```

<Note>
  You only need to run ngrok when testing webhooks (payments, emails)
</Note>

If you do use ngrok, every time you run `ngrok http 5173`, it will generate a new URL so you need to update these locations:

1. **Local Environment** (`.env.local`):
   ```bash
   FRONTEND_URL=https://new-ngrok-url.ngrok.io
   ```

2. **Convex Environment Variables**:
   - Update `FRONTEND_URL` in Convex Dashboard

3. **Vite Configuration** (`vite.config.ts`):
   ```typescript
   server: {
     allowedHosts: ["new-ngrok-subdomain.ngrok.app"],
   },
   ```

4. **Restart Servers**:
   ```bash
   # Stop and restart both dev servers
   bun run dev
   bunx convex dev
   ```
