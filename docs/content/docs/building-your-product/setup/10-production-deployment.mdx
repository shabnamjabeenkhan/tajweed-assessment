<Warning>
  You need to have already purchased a domain to be fully configure your Web App for production.
</Warning>

import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

<Callout title="Work in Progress" type="warning">
  ToDos: 
    - Record 2 videos for this page (1 for Vercel and 1 for Railway)
</Callout>

<YouTube id="UqJJktxCY9U" />

You can deploy your app to either Vercel or Railway.

<Note>
  Vercel supports Convex Preview Environments, giving each PR a live preview link. This is super helpful for reviewing PRs if you're working in a team.

3. Set the domain to your purchased domain
4. Navigate to `Configure` â†’ Scroll down to the `Developers` section â†’ `Domains`
5. Configure your domain's DNS settings based on what Clerk asks for

<Note>
  Once you're done, you'll need to wait a few minutes for Clerk to issue SSL certificates and verify its Frontend and Accounts APIs.

## Cloudflare Workers

<Note>
  Coming soon...

## Next Steps

With production deployment complete, your app is live and ready for users!

You can continue to work on your app and deploy new changes to production automatically. Everything will just work.

<Note>
  For future environment variables, the rule of thumb is that if you need to access it from the client side, you need to add it one of the above (Vercel or Railway) environment variables. If you need to access it from the server side, you need to add it to the Convex environment variables.
