## Why Documentation Matters

In the age of AI, documentation is no longer optional - it's critical. Without it, you lose context, repeat mistakes, and confuse yourself and your AI assistants as your codebase grows.

**Without docs:**
- ‚ùå Lose context between sessions
- ‚ùå Repeat the same mistakes
- ‚ùå Confuse AI assistants with missing context
- ‚ùå Struggle to onboard team members
- ‚ùå Forget why you made decisions

**With good docs:**
- ‚úÖ Better AI assistance (LLMs will love this context!)
- ‚úÖ Faster Developer onboarding (if you want to hire in the future)
- ‚úÖ Decision history (easy for you and an LLM to understand why decisions were made)
- ‚úÖ Reduced bugs and rework (easier to debug and understand why things are the way they are)

<Callout type="info">
  **You'll be using the "Project Documentation" tab in this docs site!** üìÅ

  All your project documentation lives here in the Fumadocs-powered documentation system. You'll be keeping this updated as you build.

The fastest way to create comprehensive MVP documentation is to work with an AI agent across **5 focused conversations**. Each conversation targets a specific aspect of your product, ensuring nothing gets missed.

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
<Cards>
  <Card
    title="Cursor IDE installed + Pro Subscription"
    href="https://www.cursor.so/"
    description="Ensure you have Cursor IDE and a Pro Subscription so you can use the premium models like GPT-5-High."
  />
  <Card
    title="A Validated Product Idea"
    href="/docs/company-building/idea-validation"
    description="You should an idea that has been validated through our recommended Idea Validation process."
  />
</Cards>

<Note>
  If you prefer to use Claude Code or another AI agent, feel free to do so. We simply recommend using Cursor and the GPT-5-High model for the best experience.
</Note>

### The 5-step Documentation Framework

We'll be following a comprehensive framework to help you document your product and all the important decisions you'll be making prior to actually building it, to make it easier for you and your AI assistants to execute on your idea.

## 1. Product Idea, Vision & Strategy

**Goal**: Define your product vision, target audience, core features, success metrics, competitive landscape, implementation planning, and any external dependencies you'll need.

**Duration**: `20-25 minutes`

**Model**: `gpt-5-high`

Open a new Agent tab in Cursor and use this prompt:

```markdown
I'm building an MVP and need help documenting my product vision and strategy. 

**IMPORTANT**: Before we start, please:
1. **Check the README.md file** to understand my current tech stack
2. **Perform real-time web research** on current pricing, features, and capabilities of my tech stack components
3. **Read the existing Project Documentation ‚Üí Idea page** (index.mdx) to understand what's already documented

**My Product Idea**: [Describe your product idea in 2-3 sentences]

**Current Understanding**: [What you know about your target market, competitors, etc.]

Please help me create comprehensive documentation for the "Idea" page in my Project Documentation. I want to document:

1. **Problem Statement** - What problem am I solving?
2. **Solution Overview** - How does my product solve it?
3. **Target Audience** - Who are my users?
4. **Core Features** - What features do I need for MVP?
5. **Competitive Analysis** - How am I different?
6. **Expected Scale** - How many users do I expect to have?
7. **3rd-party libraries/providers/APIs** - What external libraries/providers/APIs do I need to use (other than what my current tech stack provides)?
8. **Pricing Model Decision** - Subscription vs One-time vs Hybrid (justify with web research and product type)
9. **Implementation Planning** - Development phases, timeline estimation, resource requirements, risk assessment, success metrics, launch strategy

Use this decision framework when selecting the pricing model:

- Recurring Subscriptions
  - Use when you provide ongoing value
  - Examples: SaaS tools used regularly, monitoring services, continuous access platforms
  - Benefits: Predictable revenue, higher LTV, easier to scale

- One-Time Payments
  - Use when value is delivered once
  - Examples: Digital downloads, one-off transformations, limited-time access
  - Benefits: Simpler to manage, no recurring obligations, clear value proposition

- Hybrid Models
  - Combine both payment types
  - Examples: Setup fee + monthly access, one-time purchase + optional subscription support
  - Benefits: Maximizes revenue opportunities, caters to preferences, flexible strategy

- Product Type Considerations
  - Transformation Products ‚Üí bias to one-time (e.g., fitness apps, course platforms)
  - Utility Products ‚Üí bias to subscription (e.g., budget trackers, productivity tools)

- Currency & Pricing Psychology
  - Align currencies with target demographics
  - Use psychological pricing (e.g., $29 vs $30)

**Output**: A clear recommendation with rationale and sources. Also note downstream impacts on database schema, pricing page UX, and payments provider configuration.

Make sure to include the following section in Project Documentation ‚Üí Idea (index.mdx):

**Pricing Model Decision**

- Decision: [Subscription | One-time | Hybrid]
- Rationale: [2-4 bullets citing product type and web research]
- Product Type: [Transformation | Utility | Mixed]
- Currency & Pricing: [Primary currency and psychological price points]
- Database Impact: [Keep/remove: subscriptions tables, one-time payments tables, and invoice fields?]
- Provider/Webhooks: [Which flows are needed and why]

This section must be present in index.mdx so downstream docs (architecture, database, payments) can reference it.

**CRITICAL**: When we're done, I need you to **replace the entire content** of the Project Documentation ‚Üí Idea page (index.mdx) with our final documentation, not just provide text to copy.

Before you do that, please ask me clarifying questions and help me think through each area thoroughly. Use real-time web research to ensure accuracy of current market conditions, competitor pricing, and tech stack capabilities.
