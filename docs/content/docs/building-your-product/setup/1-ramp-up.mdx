Before setting up your project with Kaizen, you'll need to quickly get familiar with the core technologies this boilerplate uses so that it's a lot easier for you to navigate and understand the application you build.

## Core Technologies Overview

### 1. React Router v7

React Router v7 is a routing library for React. You can use it as an entire framework (as we do here in the Kaizen stack - `framework` mode) or as minimally as you want.

Convex is a backend-as-a-service that provides real-time database, serverless functions, and file storage. No need for Web server or database management. Fully type-safe and LLM-friendly.
