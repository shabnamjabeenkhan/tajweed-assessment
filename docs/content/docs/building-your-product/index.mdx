Before you can start building (web apps, mobile apps, etc.), you need to have a working local environment. These are things you only need to do once.

## Web Apps

### Node.js
Use the latest stable version (currently v24.x.x):

**Mac/Linux**:
```bash
nvm install stable
```

Verify installation:
```bash
node -v
```

### Ngrok

Required for webhook testing locally (payments, emails, etc.)

```bash
brew install ngrok
```

## Mobile Apps

<Note>
  Coming soon...
</Note>

## Required AI Tools

We heavily recommend setting up the below tools and MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers to supercharge your development workflow.

Trust me. They're going to make your life so much easier, when you're building features.

### 1. Context7: Up-to-date Docs for LLMs

Context7 solves the limitation of AI coding assistants having outdated knowledge due to training cutoffs.

**Why You Need It:**
- Access to 800+ up-to-date framework documentations
- Pulls only specific, relevant documentation pieces when needed
- Preserves context tokens for your actual code
- Includes code examples that help write accurate code
- Supports documentation search for precise information retrieval

**Installation:**
1. In Cursor, go to **Settings → MCP**
2. Add new MCP with this configuration to your existing MCP JSON object:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    // ... other MCP servers
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

3. Save and refresh Cursor (or restart if tools don't appear)

**Usage:** When prompting, explicitly ask Cursor agent to call Context7 MCP to access up-to-date knowledge without context overload.

### 2. Firecrawl: Web Scraping for Missing Documentation

<Note>
  Firecrawl is not free. You will need to add credits to your account to use it.
</Note>

Firecrawl complements Context7 by allowing you to scrape documentation from any website when it's not available in the Context7 database.

**Why You Need It:**
- Documentation for newer or niche libraries may not be in Context7 yet
- Extract specific information from websites not in any database
- Save documentation locally for future reference (saves time and cost of web research tool calls)

**Installation:**
1. In Cursor, go to **Settings → MCP**
2. Add Firecrawl to your MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Firecrawl Scraper": {
      "command": "env",
      "args": [
        "FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your-api-key-here",
        "npx",
        "-y",
        "firecrawl-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

3. Save and refresh Cursor (or restart if tools don't appear)

**Getting a Firecrawl API Key:**
- Sign up at [firecrawl.dev](https://firecrawl.dev)
- Get your free API key from the dashboard
- Replace `your-api-key-here` with your actual key

### 3. RepoPrompt: AI Context Server ($14.99/month)

RepoPrompt's MCP integration positions the application as a high-signal "AI context server" rather than a full IDE. Editors such as Cursor, Claude Code and any other MCP-compatible client can request rich project information, perform semantic searches, and even obtain high-level architectural plans directly from RepoPrompt.

**Why You Need It:**
- High-speed semantic searches across your entire codebase
- Rich project information and architectural insights
- Token-efficient context management
- Comprehensive code mapping and file operations
- Direct integration with AI coding assistants

<Note>
  You need to have RepoPrompt open for it to work alongside Cursor.
</Note>

**Installation:**
1. Download and install RepoPrompt from [repoprompt.com](https://repoprompt.com)
3. Enable Server: Open Settings → MCP Server and flip the "Enable MCP Server" toggle
4. Auto-Start (Optional): Toggle "Launch on App Start" if you want the server always on
5. Planner Model: Pick a model for request_plan (GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Ollama local, etc.)

** (Recommended) Cursor Integration (One-Click):**
1. Open Settings → MCP Server and click "Install in Cursor"
2. RepoPrompt writes a `.cursor/mcp-config.json` file and triggers a deeplink
3. Cursor opens pre-configured
4. Accept the connection prompt inside RepoPrompt if not auto-approved
5. All enabled tools are now exposed in Cursor's MCP palette

### 4. CodeRabbit CLI: AI Code Reviews (Free for Public Repos, $12/month for Private Repos)

CodeRabbit CLI provides AI-powered code reviews directly in your terminal, analyzing your uncommitted changes using the same pattern recognition that powers PR reviews.

**Why You Need It:**
- Expert-level issue detection with full codebase context
- Identifies race conditions, memory leaks, security vulnerabilities, and logic errors
- Provides actionable suggestions with specific fix recommendations
- Optimized output format for AI coding agents
- Works seamlessly with the spec-driven development workflow

**Installation:**
1. Install CodeRabbit CLI globally:
```bash
npm install -g @coderabbitai/cli
```

2. Authenticate with your CodeRabbit account:
```bash
coderabbit auth
```

3. Follow the authentication flow to link your CLI with your CodeRabbit account

**Usage in Development Workflow:**
- **Interactive mode**: `coderabbit` - Full interface with browsable findings
- **Plain text mode**: `coderabbit --plain` - Detailed feedback with fix suggestions  
- **AI agent mode**: `coderabbit --prompt-only` - Minimal output optimized for AI agents

**Integration with AI Agents:**
The `--prompt-only` mode creates a unique workflow where CodeRabbit identifies problems with full codebase context, then your AI agent implements the fixes. You get expert-level issue detection combined with AI-powered implementation.

## Domain Setup (Start Early)

### Purchase a Domain

The domain registrars we recommend are:
<Cards>
  <Card
    title="Porkbun"
    href="https://porkbun.com"
    description="Easy-to-use registrar with great pricing and DNS management."
  />
  <Card
    title="Hostinger Domains"
    href="https://www.hostinger.com/domain-name-search"
    description="Reliable and affordable domain registration and hosting services."
  />
</Cards>

Some services require domain verification and DNS record setup, which can take 12-48 hours to propagate. Start these early to avoid delays later (see below)

### Resend Email Service

If the Tech Stack you're using uses Resend for email, you'll need to set up a domain for it.

**Setup Steps:**
1. Create account at [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Go to **Domains** → **Add Domain**
3. Enter your domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)
4. Add required DNS records to your domain registrar:
   - TXT record for domain verification
   - MX record for email routing
   - CNAME record for SPF/DKIM
5. Wait for verification (12-48 hours for DNS propagation)

**Note:** You can use Resend's sandbox domain for development, but production requires your own verified domain.

## Next Steps

Once you have all prerequisites ready, we're ready to setup our project and start building!
