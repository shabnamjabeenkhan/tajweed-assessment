# Idea Validation

<Callout title="Critical" type="warning">
**Don't skip this step!** Most startups fail because they build something nobody wants. Validate first, build second.
</Callout>

## Pre-Build Checklist

Before you even start building your MVP, ask yourself these **mandatory** questions:

- **Is it a painkiller or a vitamin?** - Painkillers solve urgent problems people will pay for. Vitamins are nice-to-haves that are hard to monetize.
- **Can you test it &lt;1 month?** - If validation takes longer than a month, you're overthinking it. Start simple.
- **Do you know how to get the first 10 users?** - Have a concrete plan for reaching your initial customers.

<Callout title="Critical" type="warning">
**Critical**: If you can't answer these questions confidently, **don't start building yet**. Spend the time validating first.
</Callout>

## Why Validation Matters

**Statistics:**
- 42% of startups fail due to no market need
- 90% of startups fail overall
- Most founders waste months building the wrong thing

**Validation prevents:**
- ❌ Building features nobody wants
- ❌ Wasting time and money
- ❌ Losing motivation
- ❌ Missing market opportunities

## The Validation Process

### Step 1: Use the Founder Blueprint

Visit the **[Founder Blueprint Idea Validation Node](https://founder.codeandcreed.tech/)** to:

1. **Define your problem** - What pain point are you solving?
2. **Identify your customer** - Who has this problem?
3. **Test assumptions** - Are people willing to pay?
4. **Validate demand** - Do 100+ people want this?
5. **Define MVP scope** - What's the minimum viable product?

### Step 2: Customer Interviews

**Goal**: Talk to 20-30 potential customers

**Interview Script:**
```
1. "Tell me about how you currently solve [problem]"
2. "What's frustrating about your current solution?"
3. "If I built [solution], would you use it?"
4. "Would you pay $X/month for this?"
5. "What features are most important to you?"
```

**Red Flags:**
- ❌ "That sounds interesting" (but no commitment)
- ❌ "I might use it someday"
- ❌ "Can you add [100 features]?"

**Green Flags:**
- ✅ "Where do I sign up?"
- ✅ "I'd pay for this today"
- ✅ "This would save me [specific time/money]"

### Step 3: Pre-Sell Your Product

**Best validation**: People paying before you build

**Methods:**
1. **Waitlist** - Collect emails with Clerk waitlist mode
2. **Pre-orders** - Stripe payment links for early access
3. **Founder's Pass** - Limited spots at discounted rate
4. **Pilot Program** - Free for first 10 users in exchange for feedback

<Note>
**Target**: Get 100+ signups or 10+ pre-orders before building
</Note>

## Set Up Clerk Waitlist Mode

### Configure Clerk for Validation

**1. Enable Waitlist Mode in Clerk Dashboard:**
```typescript
// This prevents users from accessing the dashboard
// Until you're ready to launch
```

**2. Update Your Config:**
```typescript title="config.ts"
export const config: AppConfig = {
  features: {
    auth: true,
    payments: false,  // Disable until validated
    convex: true,     // For storing waitlist
  },
  ui: {
    showDashboard: false,  // Hide dashboard access
    showPricing: false,    // Hide pricing until validated
  },
};
```

**3. Create Waitlist Landing Page:**
- Show the problem you're solving
- Highlight key benefits
- Collect emails with Clerk
- Send confirmation email with Resend

### Waitlist Conversion Strategy

**Email Sequence:**
1. **Day 0**: Welcome + What to expect
2. **Day 3**: Problem deep-dive + case study
3. **Day 7**: Solution preview + beta invite
4. **Day 14**: Exclusive founder offer
5. **Day 21**: Last chance to join beta

## Validation Metrics

### Minimum Success Criteria

Before building your full MVP:

| Metric | Target | Why |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Waitlist Signups | 100+ | Shows interest |
| Pre-orders | 10+ | Proves willingness to pay |
| Customer Interviews | 20+ | Validates problem |
| Email Open Rate | 30%+ | Confirms engagement |
| Landing Page Conversion | 5%+ | Tests messaging |

<Warning>
If you can't hit these targets, **pivot or refine your idea** before building.
</Warning>

## MVP Scope Definition

### What to Build First

**Include (Core Features):**
- ✅ One primary feature that solves the main problem
- ✅ Authentication (Clerk)
- ✅ Basic dashboard
- ✅ Payment integration (Polar.sh)
- ✅ Email notifications (Resend)

**Exclude (Nice-to-Haves):**
- ❌ Advanced analytics
- ❌ Multiple integrations
- ❌ Complex workflows
- ❌ Mobile app
- ❌ AI features (unless core to product)

<Note>
**Rule of thumb**: If you can remove it without breaking the core value proposition, **remove it**.
</Note>

### Feature Prioritization Framework

Use the **RICE Score**:

**RICE = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort**

| Feature | Reach | Impact | Confidence | Effort | RICE Score |
|---------|-------|--------|------------|--------|------------|
| User Auth | 100% | 3 | 100% | 2 | 150 |
| Dashboard | 100% | 3 | 100% | 5 | 60 |
| Payments | 80% | 3 | 90% | 3 | 72 |
| AI Chat | 20% | 2 | 50% | 8 | 2.5 |

**Priority Order**: User Auth → Payments → Dashboard → AI Chat

## Common Validation Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Building First, Validating Later

**Wrong:**
```
1. Build full app
2. Launch
3. Hope customers come
```

**Right:**
```
1. Validate problem
2. Pre-sell solution
3. Build MVP
4. Launch to waitlist
```

### ❌ Mistake 2: Asking Friends and Family

Friends will lie to make you feel good. Their feedback is worthless.

**Talk to strangers who:**
- Have the problem
- Would pay to solve it
- Don't know you personally

### ❌ Mistake 3: Ignoring Negative Feedback

If 8/10 people say they won't pay:
- ❌ Don't ignore them and build anyway
- ✅ Pivot or refine your value proposition

### ❌ Mistake 4: Building Too Many Features

**More features ≠ More value**

Focus on one thing done exceptionally well.

### ❌ Mistake 5: Sticking With One Idea Too Long

**The Rapid Iteration Approach:**

- **Week 1-2**: Test your idea with a simple landing page
- **No traction?** Kill it and start another idea
- **Multiple bets**: You don't have to stick with a single idea
- **Double down**: Only when an idea shows traction (waitlist signups, genuine interest)

**Testing Methods:**
- Post ideas in public communities after creating a landing page
- Talk to people online and offline
- Get one idea off the ground before proper development

<Note>
**Remember**: You just need to get **one idea** off the ground. Then you can start proper development.
</Note>
