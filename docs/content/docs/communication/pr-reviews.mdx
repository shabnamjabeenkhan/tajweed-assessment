Great reviews keep teams fast and code healthy. Bad PRs slow everyone down. Investing in a solid review process will pay off in the long run.

With AI generating more code, specs will become the source of truth.

You and your team will have already done the prior research and created the spec during the Feature Building process:

<Cards>
  <Card
    title="Building Features"
    href="/docs/building-your-product/building-features"
    description="Building Features"
  />
</Cards>

The quality of the research and spec will thus determine the quality of the code:
- Bad research → thousands of bad lines of code
- Bad plan → hundreds of bad lines of code
- Bad code → one bad line of code

So it's critical to have a good spec (that you and your team should have already reviewed and approved)

## Prerequisite: GitHub MCP in Cursor

Why? Because it's the easiest way to get the latest PR comments in your agent's context.

- Requires Cursor v0.48.0+, GitHub PAT, (optional) Docker
- Add to your global MCP config at `~/.cursor/mcp.json`, then restart Cursor

Remote (recommended):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_GITHUB_PAT" }
    }
  }
}
```

Local (Docker):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e",
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
        "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": { "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "YOUR_GITHUB_PAT" }
    }
  }
}
```

Note: `@modelcontextprotocol/server-github` is deprecated (Apr 2025). Use `ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server`.

## Create PRs Engineers love to Review (The Author's Perspective)

### 1. Automated Review (CodeRabbit)

You don't actually need to review every single line of code in the PR. 

You can use powerful fine-tuned code review tools like [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai/) for fast, consistent feedback on production PRs. It posts inline PR comments with suggestions grounded in your codebase, application architecture, and business context:

```bash
coderabbit --prompt-only
```

### 2. Generate a Good PR Description

```markdown
Create a concise PR description based on the spec and the code changes including:
1. Problem — what’s broken or missing
2. Solution — what changed and why
3. Testing — how verified (unit/integration/manual)
4. Impact — risks and affected areas
5. Visuals — screenshots if UI changed
6. Documentation — ensure Project Documentation has been updated and where the files are located

Feature Spec file: [FEATURE_SPEC_FILE].md
```

Paste the output into your PR description. This will help the reviewer understand the core changes and the rationale behind them.

### 3. Clear Description

**Bad ❌**
```
Fixed bug
```

**Great ✅**
```
Fix auth session timeout

## Problem
Users were logged out after 30m; product expects 2h.

## Solution
Increase session timeout from 30m → 2h.

## Testing
- Session persists 2+ hours
- Manual logout still works

Fixes ticket #123
```

### 4. Ensure the PR is Focused

- Single responsibility per PR (implementing/fixing/refactoring one thing at a time)
- Lines of code doesn't actually matter as much anymore (as long as the PR is focused on one thing)

### 5. Pre-Review Checklist

Before you assign a reviewer, you should have done the following:

- [ ] No console/debug logs
- [ ] Error handling in place
- [ ] Tests pass locally (if applicable)
- [ ] No hardcoded values (use env vars)

### 6. (Post Review) Fetch PR Comments via GitHub MCP (then fix)

Run this prompt in Cursor to fetch PR comments via the GitHub MCP server and then apply fixes:

```markdown
Fetch PR comments for issue_number=#<PR_NUMBER> using the GitHub MCP server and then help me apply the fixes that make sense, and replies to any comments that are asking questions or require more information.

Then:
1) Run:
   - bun run typecheck
   - bun run build
   - bunx convex dev --once (if Convex touched)
2) If failures, iterate until green
3) Push the changes and ask for a re-review
```

## Review Process (The Reviewer's Perspective)

### 1. Review PR Description and CodeRabbit Feedback
- Skim PR description and linked spec
- Scan CodeRabbit inline comments for hotspots and critical issues

### 2. Verify Spec Alignment
- Confirm changes match the agreed spec and acceptance criteria
- Flag scope creep or missing requirements

### 3. Test the Changes
- Functionality: does it work as intended?

<Note>
  If your Tech Stack allows for preview environments, test the changes in the preview environment.
</Note>

- Tests: coverage, edge cases, failure paths (CodeRabbit will cover this)
- Performance: obvious bottlenecks avoided (CodeRabbit will cover this)
- Security: input validation, auth, secrets, PII (CodeRabbit will cover this)

### 4. Approve
- Approve the PR and merge once the changes have been tested and reviewed.
