Before you begin building with Kaizen, ensure you meet these requirements and understand the foundational concepts.

## Required Knowledge & Skills

### 1. Complete the Foundations Roadmap

You must have:
- ✅ **StackMastery Score > 80%** - Take the assessment at [stackmastery.dev](https://www.stackmastery.dev/)
- ✅ **Frontend Fundamentals** - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React
- ✅ **Backend Systems Knowledge** - Complete the [Systems Expert Fundamentals Course](https://www.algoexpert.io/systems/fundamentals)
- ✅ **Kaizen Tech Stack** - Watch the [Kaizen Tech Stack Tutorial](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUxlPfFPDnAEI0roJMdV49n29gFFzmEQ5&feature=shared)

<Warning>
If you don't meet these prerequisites, **pause here** and complete the required learning first. Building without this foundation will be frustrating and slow.
</Warning>

### 2. MacBook Setup

Ensure your development environment is fully configured:
- ✅ Latest macOS version installed
- ✅ Homebrew package manager installed
- ✅ Git configured with SSH keys
- ✅ Node.js installed (v24.x.x recommended)
- ✅ Terminal and shell configured (zsh/bash)
- ✅ Code editor installed (Cursor, VS Code, or Zed)

<Note>
Having setup issues? Use AI web search (Perplexity, Grok) to troubleshoot. Don't stay stuck!
</Note>

## Business Setup (Optional)

### Register Your Parent Company

<Note>
Only required if you plan to accept payments from customers
</Note>

**Options:**
1. **Local Entity**: Register in your country for simplicity
2. **Panama Entity**: 0% tax on international business income
3. **Consult a Professional**: Get legal/tax advice for your specific situation

**When to register:**
- ✅ Before accepting payments
- ✅ Before signing contracts with clients
- ✅ After validating your idea (don't register too early)

## Problem Solving Mindset

### Maintain the Right State of Mind

**1. Practice Gratitude & Stay Positive**
- Building is hard. You'll encounter bugs, errors, and frustration
- Remember: There is always support available
- **Reach out to mentors** for encouragement (e.g., Jameel Finch)

**2. How to Find Answers to Anything**
- **Agent Web Search**: Use built-in Cursor search or Perplexity
- **Context7 MCP**: Access up-to-date documentation for any library
- **Official Docs**: When all else fails, skim the official documentation

**3. Get Rid of Ego & Laziness**

<Warning>
**Don't stay stuck!** If you can't solve something after 30 minutes, **ask for help!**
</Warning>

Pride keeps you stuck. Humility gets you unstuck. Ask:
- AI assistants (Claude, Cursor, etc.)
- Community members in Skool
- Experienced developers

## Understanding AI Development

### Why LLMs Can't "Actually" Build Software

Read this important article: [Why LLMs Can't Build Software](https://zed.dev/blog/why-llms-cant-build-software)

**Key Takeaways:**
- LLMs are **tools**, not replacement developers
- You need to build **intuition** over time
- Context matters more than prompts
- Understanding the stack is non-negotiable

### Prompting Best Practices

**Think of AI as a Junior Developer:**

```
❌ Bad Prompt:
"Add authentication"

✅ Good Prompt:
"I need to add Clerk authentication to the app. 
We're using React Router v7 with Convex backend. 
The login should redirect to /dashboard after success.
Here's my current route structure: [paste routes.ts]"
```

**First Principles of Prompting:**
1. **Give Context**: Always explain what you're trying to achieve
2. **Be Specific**: Include file paths, error messages, and relevant code
3. **Provide Examples**: Show what you want the output to look like
4. **Don't Max Out Context**: Too much context reduces AI effectiveness

<Note>
**Pro Tip**: Attach screenshots, terminal logs, and error traces. Visual context is powerful!
</Note>

### Context Window Management

Don't overload the AI with unnecessary files. Research shows **effectiveness drops as context window fills up**.

**Best Practices:**
- Include only relevant files
- Use `@filename` to reference specific files
- Summarize large files instead of pasting them
- Clear context between unrelated tasks

## Productivity Multipliers

### Voice-to-Code: 2-3x Your Speed

<Note>
**Remember**: You can artificially 2-3x your typing speed by **talking to your machine**!
</Note>

Use voice dictation for:
- Writing prompts
- Explaining bugs
- Documenting features
- Planning architecture

### Agent Orchestration

**Master working on multiple things simultaneously:**
- Use multiple terminal windows
- Run dev server + Convex + ngrok in parallel
- Have multiple AI chat sessions for different tasks
- Context-switch efficiently between features

**Recommended Course:**
- **Lee Robinson's AI Foundations Course** (Coming soon)

### Choose the Right Tools

Visit [tools.codeandcreed.tech](https://tools.codeandcreed.tech) to find the best development tools for your budget.

**Key Tools:**
- **AI-Powered Git Commits**: Never write lazy commit messages again
- **Agent Tools**: Orchestrate multiple AI assistants
- **Productivity Extensions**: Enhance your editor

<Warning>
**Avoid lazy commits!** Read: [The Hidden Cost of Lazy Commits in Startups](https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1n7fj2s/the_hidden_cost_of_lazy_commits_in_startups_a/)

Use AI-powered git commit tools to generate meaningful commit messages.
</Warning>

## Development Environment Setup

### Install Node.js

Use the latest stable version (currently v24.x.x):

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
nvm install stable
nvm use stable
```

**Verify Installation:**
```bash
node -v  # Should show v24.x.x
npm -v   # Should show latest npm
```

### Install ngrok (For Webhook Testing)

```bash
brew install ngrok
```
