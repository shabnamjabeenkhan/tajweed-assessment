## Overview

Learn how to detect when models degrade, implement robust monitoring, and test changes safely in production environments.

## Learning Objectives

### Distribution Shifts
Detect and understand different types of drift:
- **Covariate shift**: Input distribution changes
- **Label shift**: Output distribution changes
- **Concept drift**: Input-output relationship changes
- Implement detection mechanisms for each type

### Edge Cases & Feedback Loops
Identify silent performance degradation:
- Detect and mitigate **edge cases**
- Understand **feedback loops** that amplify problems
- Prevent cascading failures in production

### Production Monitoring Strategy
Build comprehensive monitoring:
- Track **model inputs** for distribution changes
- Monitor **operational metrics** (latency, errors, cost)
- Analyze **prediction distributions** for drift
- Collect and act on **user feedback**
- Set up alerts for critical issues

### Three Pillars of Observability
Move beyond basic monitoring:
- **Metrics**: Track quantitative performance
- **Logs**: Capture detailed events
- **Traces**: Follow requests through your system
- Use observability for debugging production issues

### Testing in Production
Implement safe experimentation strategies:
- **A/B testing**: Compare two variants
- **Canary releases**: Gradual rollout to subset
- **Shadow deployments**: Run new version alongside old
- **Interleaving experiments**: Mix results from variants
- Understand statistical significance and sample sizes
