## Overview

Learn deployment strategies, model optimization techniques, and how to combine machine predictions with human expertise for production systems.

## Learning Objectives

### Model Deployment Strategies
Understand and implement different serving approaches:
- **Static serving**: Pre-computed predictions
- **Dynamic serving**: Real-time inference
- **Hybrid serving**: Combining both approaches
- Trade-offs between freshness, cost, and complexity

### Model Gateway
Build a routing layer to manage models:
- Route requests to appropriate models
- Manage costs across multiple providers
- Decouple your application from underlying models
- Enable A/B testing and gradual rollouts

### Human-in-the-Loop Workflows
Combine AI with human expertise:
- Implement **human-in-the-loop** systems
- Build **cost-sensitive workflows** 
- Know when to defer to human judgment
- Scale human review efficiently

### Model Optimization
Make models faster and more efficient:
- **Pruning**: Remove unnecessary model parameters
- **Quantization**: Reduce numerical precision
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Train smaller student models
- **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**: Efficient fine-tuning
- Understand speed vs. accuracy tradeoffs

### Caching Strategies
Reduce latency and cost through intelligent caching:
- **Exact caching**: Cache identical requests
- **Semantic caching**: Cache semantically similar requests
- Implement cache invalidation strategies
- Balance cache size and hit rate
