## Overview

Learn how to build AI systems you can trust by implementing guardrails, performing systematic error analysis, and ensuring data quality.

## Learning Objectives

### Input & Output Guardrails
- Implement **input guardrails** to block harmful content
- Add **output guardrails** to fix responses before users see them
- Create safety layers around your AI systems

### Error Analysis
- Perform systematic error analysis
- Find and fix the most critical failures
- Prioritize improvements based on impact

### LLM-as-a-Judge
- Use LLMs to automate evaluation of generative models
- Create custom, nuanced evaluation criteria
- Scale your evaluation process

### Testing Strategies
Implement comprehensive testing approaches:
- **Backtesting**: Evaluate models on historical data
- **Invariance Testing**: Verify consistency across minor input changes
- **Behavioral Testing**: Check critical edge cases
- Ensure models behave correctly in production scenarios

### Data Quality & Integrity
Prevent common data issues:
- **Data leakages**: Ensure proper train/test separation
- **Class imbalance**: Handle skewed distributions
- Use **resampling** techniques (over/under-sampling)
- Apply **threshold moving** for optimal decision boundaries
- Implement **cost-sensitive learning** for imbalanced scenarios
