## Overview

Learn how to keep models up-to-date through continual learning and build reliable agentic systems that can collaborate to solve complex problems.

## Learning Objectives

### Retraining Strategies
Understand different approaches to model updates:
- **Stateless training**: Retrain from scratch
- **Stateful training**: Incremental updates
- Trade-offs between each approach
- When to use periodic vs. continuous retraining

### Catastrophic Forgetting
Prevent models from losing previous knowledge:
- Understand why models forget
- Implement techniques to preserve knowledge
- Balance old vs. new information
- Use rehearsal and regularization strategies

### Simple vs. Complex Agents
Design appropriate agentic systems:
- **Simple, reliable workflows**: Deterministic, debuggable systems
- **Complex autonomous agents**: Planning, memory, and tool use
- Understand when to use each approach
- Build incrementally from simple to complex

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)
Standardize agent-tool interactions:
- Understand the **MCP** specification
- Connect agents to external tools and data
- Simplify complex integrations
- Build reusable tool interfaces

### Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol
Enable multi-agent collaboration:
- Use the **A2A protocol** for agent communication
- Enable agents to discover each other
- Implement task delegation between agents
- Build collaborative systems to solve complex problems
- Manage agent coordination and conflict resolution
