## How To Start (Almost) Any Project

How to start every project with a discovery phase and use a simple 8-question checklist to frame complex problems in ways that make useful solutions inevitable.

## Understanding the first rule of machine learning and how to use simple rules to build prototypes to validate assumptions and gather feedback.

## Determining the value of collecting additional data and understanding what a good dataset looks like.

## Converting data into numerical vectors with label encoding, one-hot encoding, target encoding, and tokenization.

## Engineering predictive features from raw data using feature engineering techniques and implementing strategies for handling missing values.

## Designing a labeling strategy and using Active Learning, uncertainty, and diversity sampling to automate labeling data at scale.
