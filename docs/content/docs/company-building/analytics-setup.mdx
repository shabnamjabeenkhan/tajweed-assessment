## DataFast ‚Äî Revenue-first analytics

- Shows which marketing channels bring PAYING customers (not vanity metrics)
- Revenue attribution via Stripe, LemonSqueezy, Polar; funnels/goals/journeys
- Ultra-fast script (~4kb); works with React Router and modern stacks

Use it to prioritize channels by Revenue per Visitor and double down on what works.

## PostHog ‚Äî Session replays (capture behavior)

Minimal setup:

```bash
npm i posthog-js
```

```ts
import posthog from 'posthog-js'
posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', { api_host: 'https://us.posthog.com' })
```

Then enable Session Recordings in Project Settings. Optionally add a reverse proxy to avoid blockers. Control what to record with URL/event triggers, feature flags, or sampling.

Docs: [Session replay install](https://posthog.com/docs/session-replay/installation), [Control recordings](https://posthog.com/docs/session-replay/how-to-control-which-sessions-you-record), [JS library](https://posthog.com/docs/libraries/js)

## Human Behavior ‚Äî AI-analyzed replays (understand ‚Äúwhy‚Äù)

- AI watches your session replays and extracts key moments automatically
- Natural language queries across sessions; smart ticketing with Linear/GitHub
- Works by installing their SDK or connecting PostHog/LogRocket/Hotjar

Use it to find why users don‚Äôt convert and where flows break‚Äîwithout scrubbing hours of video.
