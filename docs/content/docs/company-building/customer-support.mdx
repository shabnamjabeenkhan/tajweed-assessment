Customer support is critical for product success.** Poor support leads to churn, negative reviews, and lost revenue. Invest in support infrastructure early.

Customer support serves multiple purposes:

**1. Customer Retention**
- Resolve issues quickly to prevent churn
- Build customer loyalty through excellent service
- Turn frustrated customers into advocates

**2. Product Improvement**
- Identify bugs and usability issues
- Gather feature requests and feedback
- Understand customer pain points

**3. Business Intelligence**
- Track support metrics and trends
- Identify common issues for proactive fixes
- Measure customer satisfaction

<Note>
  **Key Principle:** Great support is proactive, not reactive. Build systems that prevent issues before customers encounter them.
