<Warning>
  **This page covers PARENT COMPANY setup - done ONCE to create your business entity.**
  
  Company registration is only necessary in two specific scenarios:
  
   1) When your product accepts payments (requires legal entity for Payment Processors like Stripe etc.), 
   
   or 
   
   2) When building an agency.
</Warning>

## Understanding the Structure

Your parent company serves as a single business entity that can handle:

**1. Your Own Products**
- Multiple SaaS products under your company
- Unified legal entity and accounting
- Your company retains all IP and control
- Your company handles all billing and customer relationships

**2. Agency Services**
- Client project development
- Consulting and technical services  
- Client owns the final product and IP
- Clear handover of assets and credentials

<Note>
  **Key Principle:** One parent company → Multiple products/projects. Each product gets its own domain, branding, and setup process, but operates under your single legal entity.
</Note>

## Full Process

### 1. Buy Your Company Domain

Purchase a domain for your **parent company** (prefer a `.com` domain).

Recommended registrars: [Hostinger](https://www.hostinger.com/) or [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/)

<Note>
  This domain is for your company's main website and email. Each product you build will get its own domain later.
</Note>

### 2. Setup Company Email

Establish professional communication channels for your **parent company operations**.

**Company Email Setup**
<Cards>
  <Card
    title="Google Workspace"
    description="Professional email hosting for your company. £6/email/month."
    href="https://youtu.be/JlszyJlyXgo?feature=shared"
    linkText="Setup Tutorial"
  />
</Cards>

**Required Company Email:**
- `admin@yourcompany.com` - Main admin email for all business operations (banking, accounting, legal correspondence, and company registration)

**Additional Emails (optional):**
- `agency@yourcompany.com` - For agency client communications (only if doing agency work)
- `hello@yourcompany.com` - General inquiries about your company
- `support@yourcompany.com` - Customer support across all your products

<Warning>
  **Important:** This Google Workspace setup only needs to be setup for your **parent company**. Not for each product.
</Warning>

### 3. Register Your Parent Company

Now that you have your company email setup, register a single parent company that will house both your own products and (optionally) agency services.

You have 2 options:

<Cards>
  <Card
    title="Register in Panama"
    description="More expensive, but helps you avoid taxes. 0% tax on foreign-sourced income, strong privacy, ~$3,000 setup, 5–10 business days, no need to travel."
    href="https://www.thejerzway.com/business-formation/panama-srl-company"
  />
  <Card
    title="Register Locally"
    description="Much cheaper, but you will have to pay taxes. Process will differ from country to country."
  />
</Cards>

<Note>
  Choose a company name that's broad enough to accommodate both your product business and agency services. Avoid names that pigeonhole you into a specific niche.
</Note>

### 4. Setup Business Banking

Establish a business bank account in your country of registration to keep your finances separate from your personal funds. 

<Note>
  Strictly separate business and personal expenses from day one - this simplifies accounting, tax compliance, and makes your business more credible to clients and investors.
</Note>

### 5. Setup Company Payment Processing

Establish the payment system for your **parent company**.

<Cards>
  <Card
    title="Stripe"
    description="Payment processing for your company. 2.9% + £0.30 per transaction."
    href="https://youtu.be/-g3nUV_y648?feature=shared"
    linkText="Setup Tutorial"
  />
</Cards>

Your company Stripe account can handle payments for multiple products and client projects. Each will be tracked separately for accounting purposes.

## Next Steps

Now that you've setup your parent company, you can start building your products.
