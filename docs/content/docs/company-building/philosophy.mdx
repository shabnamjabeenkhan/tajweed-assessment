There are 5 core principles that guide our company building philosophy:

1. Idea Validation
2. Building in Public
3. Don't Reinvent the Wheel
4. Distribution
5. Get a Co-Founder (eventually)

## Idea Validation

Never build something that no one wants or that doesn't solve a painful problem. We created a guide just for this:

Once you've confirmed that this is a product people want, and you're fully aware of all the potential pitfalls, costs, and risks, it's time to start building.

## Building in Public

We believe it's important to build in public because:

- it forces you to be transparent and accountable
- it allows you to get feedback from your target audience and iterate on your product quickly

You'll have an amazing opportunity to build something your users love.

Listen attentively to their feedback. Iterate aggressively.

Until you have a great product, nothing else matters.

Building in public can also attract potential employers and opportunities:

## Don't Reinvent the Wheel

Resist the urge.

We've built multiple boilerplates (tech stacks) to help you save time and build products faster.

You don't need to integrate with key-vendors yourself.

Why?

Because it allows you to focus on your unique value proposition (Your product's features)

## Distribution

A perfect product no one knows about will never make a dime.

Marketing and Distribution, in most cases, is harder than building the actual product.

Knowing where your target audience hangs out online/offline and converting those people into customers is crucial to bringing your product to market.

If you don't have a clear distribution strategy, you're leaving money on the table.

And if you want to be really massive, then you need to confirm that your total serviceable market (TSM) is going to be big even in the next 5-10 years.

## Get a Co-Founder (eventually)

Sometimes you have to cruise solo for a while, but eventually you'll need to find a co-founder to help you handle the workload.

The benefit of being a part of this community is that you'll be able to find a lot of like-minded technical AND non-technical folks who you can partner with. Take time to engage, collaborate, and build relationships with fellow members before looking elsewhere.

For the best performance, one person should be dedicated solely to marketing and distribution, while the other two focus on development.

Having multiple co-founders allows for continuous progress, diverse skill sets, and shared responsibilities, ultimately leading to faster development and a more robust product. It also keeps everyone's morale high. Doing absolutely everything solo is soul-crushing.

The best teams start off with two or three co-founders. You want to be proud of how much you can get done with a small number of employees.

Hire slowly.

Stay as lean as possible for as long as possible.

But you might be wondering, how do I choose a co-founder?

Aside from track-record, experience, and skills, you should also look for humility.

Don't go into business with someone too arrogant to ever admit they are wrong.

Arrogance destroys companies.

You need someone humble and level-headed, especially when things go wrong (and they will).

As a rule of thumb, if you've never heard them say "I'm sorry" or "I was wrong", then they're unlikely to be the right person to be in business with.

Likewise, consider their relationship with their Creator:

> Don't expect loyalty from someone who doesn't obey their Creator.
>
> Don't expect someone to change themselves for you, if they refuse to change for the sake of their Creator.

This is specific advise to the Muslims reading this.

If you know someone who commits sins openly and are hard to advise (arrogant, aggressive, ageist, etc.), what deludes you into thinking they will be a good partner in business?

Remember what our Creator has mentioned about those who are too proud:

"لَا يَدْخُلُ الْجَنَّةَ مَنْ كَانَ فِي قَلْبِهِ مِثْقَالُ ذَرَّةٍ مِنْ كِبْرٍ"

"Whoever has in his heart the weight of a mustard seed of pride shall not enter Paradise"

[صحيح مسلم ٩١]

The same principle can be applied to Non-Muslims. As long as they are humble and don't prevent you from practicing your Deen, and are willing to work together, then there's no harm in working with them.

Your actions will speak louder than your words. You'll have an opportunity to show them Islaam through your character.
