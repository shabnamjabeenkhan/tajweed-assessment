## Choose Your Stack

We offer two battle-tested stacks depending on your preferences:

<Note>
  Estimated time to complete: 2-3 weeks

  Or just a few hours if you're semi-familiar with some of the technologies and just want to rapidly build something. (Looking at you, indie hackers! ;)
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="(Recommended) Option 1: Kaizen (React Router v7 + Convex)">
    [Kaizen](https://kaizen.codeandcreed.tech/) is our modern React Router v7 boilerplate designed for speed and correctness:

    **Tech Stack:**
    - React Router v7 for full-stack React development
    - Convex for real-time database and serverless functions
    - Clerk for authentication as a service
    - Polar.sh for subscription billing and payments
    - Resend for email as a service
    - OpenAI for AI chat capabilities (optional)

    **Best for:** Developers who want maximum type safety, real-time features, and AI-friendly code generation with minimal backend complexity.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Option 2: Titan (Next.js + Supabase)">
    [Titan](https://titan.codeandcreed.tech/) is our Next.js-based stack for rapid product development:

    **Tech Stack:**
    - Next.js 15 for full-stack development
    - Drizzle for type-safe database access
    - Supabase for authentication and realtime features
    - Tanstack Query for data fetching
    - Webhooks for third-party integrations

    **Best for:** Developers who prefer Next.js, want direct SQL control, or need specific Supabase features.
  </Step>
