# Claude Code Sound Hooks - Setup Complete! ðŸ”Š

Your Claude Code sound notification system is now ready to use!

## What Was Implemented

âœ… **Hook System**: Created `.claude/hooks/` directory structure  
âœ… **Python Handler**: Smart script that processes Claude Code events  
âœ… **Sound Files**: Simple, pleasant alert sounds (no meows!)  
âœ… **Configuration**: `settings.json` configured for stop and notification events  
âœ… **Testing**: Verified the system works correctly  

## How It Works

When Claude Code runs in this project, you'll now hear:

- **Task Complete Sound**: When Claude finishes a task (`stop` event)
- **Attention Needed Sound**: When Claude needs your manual confirmation (`notification` event)

## Files Created

```
settings.json                    # Hooks configuration
.claude/hooks/
â”œâ”€â”€ hook_handler.py             # Main Python script
â”œâ”€â”€ hook_handler.log            # Debug log file
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                   # Customization guide
â”œâ”€â”€ SETUP_COMPLETE.md           # This file
â””â”€â”€ sounds/
    â”œâ”€â”€ task_complete.aiff      # Task completion sound
    â””â”€â”€ attention_needed.aiff   # User attention sound
```

## Next Steps

1. **Try it out**: Run some Claude Code commands and listen for the sounds
2. **Customize sounds**: Replace the `.aiff` files in `sounds/` directory with your preferred alert sounds
3. **Adjust events**: Edit `settings.json` to add/remove hook events as needed

## Troubleshooting

- **No sounds playing?** Check that your system volume is up and audio is working
- **Want different sounds?** Replace the files in `.claude/hooks/sounds/`
- **Need debugging?** Check `.claude/hooks/hook_handler.log` for event details

## Sound Credits

Current sounds were generated using macOS's built-in `say` command with "Boing" and "Sosumi" voices.

Enjoy your enhanced Claude Code experience! ðŸŽµ
