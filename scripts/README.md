# Video Scripts for Startup Accelerator Documentation

This folder contains detailed video scripts for each page of the Startup Accelerator documentation site.

## Purpose

The documentation site is designed as a comprehensive video course where the instructor walks through building a real SaaS product from the ground up. Each page corresponds to a video that demonstrates:

- How to actually validate your idea before building
- Custom project documentation setup to prevent LLM hallucinations
- Initial schema/architecture scaffolding
- Building UI really fast without wasting time on CSS
- How to build and test any feature using spec-driven development
- Effective debugging techniques
- Deployment to Railway and self-hosting
- User analytics and marketing decisions
- Understanding user needs through voting-based feature requests
- Maintenance, release management, and customer support

## Script Structure

Each script includes:
- **VIDEO LENGTH**: Estimated duration
- **HOOK**: Opening line to grab attention
- **Detailed content**: Step-by-step walkthrough
- **VISUAL NOTES**: What to show on screen

- **Comprehensive**: Everything included, nothing assumed

## Recording Notes

- Use screen recording with webcam inset
- Show terminal commands being typed
- Demonstrate actual code changes
- Include before/after comparisons
- Add progress indicators and checklists
- End with clear next steps and calls-to-action
