[OPENING - 0:00-0:15]
"AI is transforming software development, but most tutorials focus on toy examples that break in production. This curriculum teaches you to build AI systems that users can actually trust and rely on.

I'm walking you through the complete AI engineering lifecycle - from problem discovery to production maintenance."

[WHAT YOU'LL LEARN - 0:15-1:00]

"The complete lifecycle of production AI engineering:

**Problem Framing & Data:**
- Start projects with proper discovery
- Engineer features effectively
- Automate data labeling and quality checks

**Model Development:**
- Build robust RAG systems
- Select and evaluate models properly
- Establish reliable evaluation protocols

**Trust & Safety:**
- Implement input/output guardrails
- Perform thorough error analysis
- Ensure data quality and reliability

**Production Deployment:**
- Deploy models efficiently at scale
- Optimize for cost and performance
- Implement intelligent caching

**Monitoring & Maintenance:**
- Detect model drift and degradation
- Implement comprehensive observability
- Test effectively in production environments

**Advanced Systems:**
- Build continual learning pipelines
- Create agentic systems with MCP and A2A
- Automate model improvement over time"

If you can write code and understand APIs, you can follow this curriculum."

[LEARNING PATH - 3:00-3:30]

"Sessions build progressively:

1. **Discovery** - Frame problems correctly
2. **Build Systems** - Create reliable RAG systems
3. **Ensure Trust** - Add safety and quality measures
4. **Deploy Efficiently** - Optimize for production scale
5. **Monitor Continuously** - Detect and fix issues
6. **Scale & Automate** - Build self-improving systems

Each session includes practical examples, code samples, and production-ready patterns."

[PREREQUISITES - 3:30-3:45]

"Before starting:
- Basic programming (Python recommended)
- REST APIs and web services
- Databases and data structures
- Basic statistics (helpful but not required)

If you're comfortable with code and willing to learn, you're ready."

[GETTING STARTED - 3:45-4:00]

"Ready to begin your AI engineering journey? Start with Session 1: Discovery Phase - learning how to frame AI problems correctly is the foundation of everything that follows.

This isn't just about building AI - it's about building AI that works reliably in the real world. Let's get started!"
