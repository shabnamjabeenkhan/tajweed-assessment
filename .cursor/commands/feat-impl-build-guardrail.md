# Bun Verify & Build Checklist

Use this command whenever you finish your changes so the workflow always matches our tooling expectations.

## Package Manager

**Use `bun` for every install, script, or task. No npm/pnpm/yarn.**

## Change Verification

Before running commands, review your diff and confirm only the intended files changed.

## Lint Check

Run the repo's lint step (or the relevant `bun run lint`/`bun run typecheck` command here) and clear every warning/error.

## Build

Execute `bun run build` and confirm it succeeds without warnings that require action.

## Convex Compilation

Execute `bunx convex dev --once` and ensure there are zero schema/validator/runtime compilation issues.

## Re-verify

After the commands pass, re-check `git status` to make sure no unexpected files changed during the process.

## Failure Handling

If any command fails, fix the issue immediately and rerun the checklist from the failing step onward.

# MDX File Guidelines

## CRITICAL: The `<` character in MDX files

MDX interprets `<` as the start of a JSX component. This causes build errors like:

- `Unexpected character before name`
- `Unexpected end of file in name`

### Common mistakes:

- ❌ `Cost reduced to <$1` → MDX sees `<$1` as a broken JSX tag
- ❌ `<5 min response time` → MDX sees `<5` as a broken JSX tag
- ❌ `<2% error rate` → MDX sees `<2` as a broken JSX tag
- ❌ `if (x < 10)` → In inline code this is fine, but in prose it breaks

### Fixes:

- ✅ `Cost reduced to under $1`
- ✅ `Under 5 min response time`
- ✅ `Less than 2% error rate`
- ✅ `` `if (x < 10)` `` → Wrap in backticks for code
- ✅ `&lt;5 min` → Use HTML entity (ugly but works)

### Rule

When writing MDX content, **NEVER** use bare `<` followed by numbers or `$`. Always use:

- `"under"`, `"less than"`, `"below"` instead of `<`
- `"over"`, `"greater than"`, `"above"` instead of `>`
- Or wrap in backticks if it's code: `` `<5` ``

### Pre-commit Check

Before committing any `.mdx` file, search for `<[0-9]` and `<\$` patterns and fix them.
