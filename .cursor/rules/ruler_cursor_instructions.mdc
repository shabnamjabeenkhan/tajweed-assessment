# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
The `app/` directory is the React Router v7 application: route modules live in `app/routes/`, shared UI in `app/components/`, hooks in `app/hooks/`, utilities in `app/utils/`, and client helpers in `app/lib/`. The `convex/` folder contains serverless functions, schema definitions, and Convex configuration. Static assets reside in `public/`, deployment outputs in `build/`, and operational runbooks in `guides/`. Configuration defaults sit in `config.example.ts`; copy to `config.ts` for local overrides.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Run `bun run dev` for the full-stack dev server with hot reload. `bun run build` creates the production bundle under `build/`. Use `bun run start` to serve the built output locally. Verify types and regenerate React Router loaders with `bun run typecheck`, which runs `react-router typegen` before `tsc` via bunx.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Write TypeScript everywhere, using ES modules and strict typing. Prefer PascalCase for React components, camelCase for functions and variables, and kebab-case for route filenames (e.g., `pricing.tsx`). Co-locate loader/action logic with their route module. Favor Tailwind utility classes over custom CSS; place shared design tokens in `app/app.css` only when unavoidable. Keep Convex queries and mutations in files that match their domain (`subscriptions.ts`, `users.ts`).

## Testing Guidelines
The project currently relies on type safety and manual QA. When adding complex logic, scaffold Vitest + React Testing Library tests beside the code (e.g., `Component.test.tsx`) and gate networked code behind mocks. At minimum, run `npm run typecheck` before every PR and include screenshots or recordings for UI changes.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Follow the existing history pattern of short, imperative commit subjects ("Update integrations links text"). Group related changes together and avoid unrelated refactors. Pull requests should include a concise summary, linked issue or Linear ticket, and a checklist of executed commands. Mention any new environment variables, schema migrations, or Convex changes, and attach proof of testing (command output, screenshots).

## React Router & Convex Tips
Always import route types from `./+types/[route]` when accessing loader data, and rerun `npm run typecheck` if those files go stale. Convex deployments expect the schema in `convex/schema.ts`; keep mutations idempotent and document new functions in `convex/README.md`.

## Communication Rules (for AI coding agents)

DO NOT GIVE ME HIGH LEVEL STUFF, IF I ASK FOR FIX OR EXPLANATION, I WANT ACTUAL CODE OR EXPLANATION!!! I DON'T WANT "Here's how you can blablabla"

### General Guidelines

• Be casual unless otherwise specified
• Be terse
• Suggest solutions that I didn't think about--anticipate my needs
• Treat me as an expert
• Be accurate and thorough
• Give the answer immediately. Provide detailed explanations and restate my query in your own words if necessary after giving the answer
• Value good arguments over authorities, the source is irrelevant
• Consider new technologies and contrarian ideas, not just the conventional wisdom
• You may use high levels of speculation or prediction, just flag it for me
• No moral lectures
• Discuss safety only when it's crucial and non-obvious
• If your content policy is an issue, provide the closest acceptable response and explain the content policy issue afterward
• Cite sources whenever possible at the end, not inline
• No need to mention your knowledge cutoff
• No need to disclose you're an AI
• Please respect my prettier preferences when you provide code
• Split into multiple responses if one response isn't enough to answer the question

### Code Adjustments

• If I ask for adjustments to code I have provided you, do not repeat all of my code unnecessarily. Instead try to keep the answer brief by giving just a couple lines before/after any changes you make. Multiple code blocks are ok.

• DO NOT CHANGE ANY FUNCTIONALITY OTHER THAN WHAT I ASK FOR. If I ask for UI changes, do not change any business logic.

### Verification Rules

• Do not present speculation, deduction, or hallucination as fact

• When unsure about information, perform a web search first to verify before responding

• If still unverified after searching, say:
  - "I cannot verify this."
  - "I do not have access to that information."

• Label all unverified content clearly:
  - `[Inference]`, `[Speculation]`, `[Unverified]`

• If any part is unverified, label the full output

• Ask instead of assuming

• Never override user facts, labels, or data

• Do not use these terms unless quoting the user or citing a real source:
  `Prevent, Guarantee, Will never, Fixes, Eliminates, Ensures that`

• For LLM behavior claims, include:
  `[Unverified]` or `[Inference]`, plus a note that it's expected behavior, not guaranteed

• If you break this directive, say:
  "Correction: I previously made an unverified or speculative claim without labeling it. That was an error."

## React Router v7 Framework Mode - Critical Rules

- ALWAYS import route types from `./+types/[routeName]`.
- Run `npm run typecheck` after adding/renaming routes or if `./+types` imports fail.
- Use `href()` for dynamic URLs; do not manually construct route strings.
- Layout routes with children must render `<Outlet />`.
- Use loaders/actions for data; avoid fetching in components.

# Claude Code Guidance

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Kaizen is a modern full-stack SaaS starter template built with React Router v7, Convex, Clerk, Polar.sh, and other modern tools. It features a flexible configuration system that allows enabling/disabling major features like authentication, payments, backend, and email services.

## Development Commands

### Core Development
- `bun run dev` - Start development server with HMR
- `bun run build` - Build for production
- `bun run start` - Start production server
- `bun run typecheck` - Run TypeScript checks with route generation

## Configuration Architecture

### Feature Flag System
The entire application is controlled by `config.ts` which uses feature flags to enable/disable major functionality:

```typescript
export const config: AppConfig = {
  features: {
    auth: boolean,      // Clerk authentication
    payments: boolean,  // Polar.sh billing
    convex: boolean,    // Convex database
    email: boolean,     // Resend via Convex
    monitoring: boolean // Error reporting
  },
  services: { /* service configurations */ },
  ui: { /* UI visibility flags */ }
}
```

### Configuration Validation
- `validateConfig()` - Validates required environment variables for enabled features
- `initializeConfig()` - Initializes and validates configuration at app startup
- `syncConfigWithEnv()` - Syncs feature flags to environment variables for Convex

## Key Architecture Patterns

### Full-Stack React Router v7
- SSR-enabled by default with React Router v7
- File-based routing in `app/routes/`
- Loaders and actions for data fetching and mutations
- Protected routes using Clerk authentication when enabled

### Convex Backend Integration
- Real-time database with automatic sync
- Serverless functions in `convex/` directory
- Schema definition in `convex/schema.ts`
- Webhook handlers for external service events
- Built-in exception reporting (Pro feature)

### Service Integration Pattern
- Conditional imports based on feature flags
- Environment variable validation for enabled services
- Graceful degradation when services are disabled
- Webhook event handling for Polar.sh payments

## Database Schema (Convex)

### Core Tables
- `users` - User profiles with Clerk token identifier
- `subscriptions` - Polar.sh subscription data with comprehensive tracking
- `webhookEvents` - Webhook event logging for external services

### Key Indexes
- `users.by_token` - Fast user lookup by Clerk token
- `subscriptions.userId` - User subscription lookup
- `subscriptions.polarId` - Polar.sh subscription ID lookup

## Environment Variables

### Always Required
- `FRONTEND_URL` - Frontend URL for callbacks and redirects

### Feature-Dependent (based on config.ts)
- Convex: `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT`, `VITE_CONVEX_URL`
- Clerk: `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`
- Polar.sh: `POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `POLAR_ORGANIZATION_ID`, `POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- Resend: `RESEND_API_KEY`, `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- OpenAI: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Sentry: `VITE_SENTRY_DSN`, `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT`

## Component Architecture

### UI Components
- shadcn/ui components in `app/components/ui/`
- Radix UI primitives for accessibility
- TailwindCSS v4 for styling with utility classes
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

### Feature Components
- Homepage sections in `app/components/homepage/`
- Dashboard components in `app/components/dashboard/`
- Conditional rendering based on feature flags

## Development Workflow

### Before Making Changes
1. Check feature flags in `config.ts` to understand enabled features
2. Verify environment variables for active services
3. Run typecheck to ensure TypeScript compliance

### Code Style Requirements
- TypeScript-first - All code must be properly typed
- React Router v7 patterns - Use loaders/actions for data fetching
- Conditional feature logic - Respect feature flags throughout
- Component composition - Use shadcn/ui patterns for consistency

## Common Patterns

### Feature Flag Checking
```typescript
import { isFeatureEnabled } from '~/config';

if (isFeatureEnabled('auth')) {
  // Auth-specific logic
}
```

### Service Configuration Access
```typescript
import { getServiceConfig } from '~/config';

const clerkConfig = getServiceConfig('clerk');
```

### Protected Route Implementation
```typescript
// Use Clerk's built-in protection when auth is enabled
// Graceful fallback when auth is disabled
```

## Production Considerations

### Deployment Options
- Railway (recommended) - Simple deployment with automatic scaling and PR previews
- Self-hosted VPS - Full control with included Dockerfile and nginx configuration
- Docker - Multi-stage production build with optimized layers

### Performance
- SSR optimization with React Router v7
- Code splitting automatic with Vite
- Asset optimization built into build process
- Real-time sync with Convex for data consistency

### Monitoring
- Convex built-in exception reporting for backend errors (Pro)
- Frontend error boundaries for graceful error handling
- OpenStatus integration for uptime monitoring
- Sentry integration for additional frontend monitoring

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Configuration Errors
- Run `validateConfig()` to check for missing environment variables
- Ensure feature flags match enabled services
- Check `config.example.ts` for reference configurations

### Development Server Issues
- Ensure Bun is installed (bun >= 1.1)
- Use `bun install` for dependency resolution
- Check that required services are running (Convex dev server)
